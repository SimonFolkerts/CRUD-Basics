  /* NOTE: objects aren't copied when they are assigned to variables.
  When you assign an object to a variable, that variable now 'points to' or 'references' the original object.
  For example if we have an object { name: "simon" } stored in a variable called myObject, and we assign myObject to a new variable like this:

    const newVariable = myObject;

  both newVariable and myObject contain the same object, not two separate copies. If we alter the object in one, e.g.:

    newVariable.name = "bob";

  Then that change is also reflected in the other:
  
    console.log(myObject.name);
    outputs: bob
  
  This is because objects and arrays are passed by reference, not by value, unlike primiteves (numbers, strings, booleans).
  What this means is that if we find the object in the array, we can simply assign it to a variable such as requestedUser above,
  and then modify it directly. This means we don't have to splice the array and replace it with a new one, or find the index of the object
  and modify the element in the array using the index to directly target it. We simpley create a new reference to it and modity the reference, which updates the original.
*/

  // update the object values (this works becuase objects are passed by reference not value, so we aren't just modifying a copy, but the original object in the array)
  requestedUser.name = req.body.name;
  requestedUser.role = req.body.role;

  // confirm that item was updated by logging the array, once we know it's working, we can remove this
  console.log(array);

  // finally, overwrite the old file contents with the new updated array by stringifying (converting to JSON) and writing the array to the file
  fs.writeFileSync("./data.json", JSON.stringify(array));

  // don't forget to finish the HTTP interaction (usually we would send back a redirect or a refresh response)

// -------------------------------

// delete by id. In this instance, we want to remove an object from the array entirely. We can use .splice() for this
app.delete("/:userId", (req, res) => {
  const rawData = fs.readFileSync("./data.json");
  // decode buffer to JS to get the user array
  const array = JSON.parse(rawData);

  // now that we have the array, we need to be able to splice out the entry we want to get rid of. For that, we need the index of the item
  // we can use .findIndex() for this (it returns the index of the matching element in the array)

    (user) => user.id == req.params.userId
  );

  /*
  So we have the index of the object that is to be deleted, we can now use .splice() to remove it.
  .splice() needs at least two things to do this, a start position in the array, and the number of things to delete.
  We want to delete one (1) item, at the index of the target element.
  Note: splice doesn't create a   modified copy, it modifies the original array, so no return value needed to be captured in a variable here
